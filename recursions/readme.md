# Recursions
Two rules when writing recursive functions: 
- There must be one or more base cases.
- When the subroutine is applied recursively, it must be applied to a problem that is smaller than the original problem.

## Recursion vs iteration
Any thing you can do with a recursion can be done iteratively. 

### Recursion
Pros:
- DRY
- Readability

Cons:
- Large Stack

### Iteration
Pros: 
- Less stack

Cons: 
- Harder to read
